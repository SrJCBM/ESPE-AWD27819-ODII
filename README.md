**TravelBrain** is a web-based application that automatically generates personalized travel itineraries based on weather, budget, and distance.  
The system integrates multiple APIs to provide real-time data for travel planning, including route estimation, weather forecasts, currency conversion, and destination imagery.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate:
- Integration of multiple external APIs  
- Implementation of CRUD operations  
- Development of a user-centered travel planning system
